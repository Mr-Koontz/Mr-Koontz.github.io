# Report Cards: How-To
A quick and dirty guide to do report cards without needing revisions.

## Fast Facts

 - If a student has not been assigned a class, assign them a "**NG**" grade and leave the following message in the comments: 
 > *Course was not assigned for the semester. This course will be assigned for the following semester.*
- Ensure that, especially for students  earning less than an A, you list at least one place for improvement.
- Save All then show a Print Preview. Save this Preview as a PDF and send it to your counselor before finalizing.

## Progress Reports (Mid-Semester)
High School- For all progress reports we will be using a template (located in teacher drive) and adding courses manually that students have been working on during the semester. Since progress reports are given mid-semester, this report will not show ALL courses, just the courses the student has been working on so far. 

Middle school and elementary- For your students you will also use the template and manually add all subjects the student has been working on. An appropriate progress grade should be given for all subjects, along with a comment.
